# JShell

	Developed a program which works like the terminal shell used in macOS and Linux environment.

	Designed collaborations of various classes with CRC cards, following single responsibility principle.

	Coded in Java because Java is object-oriented, which allowed me to create modular programs and reusable code.

	Tested the program using JUnit tests to ensure early failure detection and stable development.

	Used Subversion for version control to simulate a software development process.
