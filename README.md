# JShell

⚫ Developed a program which works like the terminal shell used in macOS and Linux systems.

⚫ Designed collaborations of various classes with CRC cards, following single responsibility principle.

⚫ Coded in Java because Java is object-oriented, which allowed creating modular programs and reusable
code.

⚫ Tested the program using JUnit tests to ensure early failure detection and stable development.

⚫ Worked in a Scrum team, created product backlogs and sprint backlogs with three members.

⚫ Used Subversion for version control to simulate a software development process.
